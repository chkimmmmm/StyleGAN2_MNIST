# StyleGAN2 for MNIST

I release StyleGAN2 for MNIST.\
The main code is based on [labmlai](https://github.com/labmlai/annotated_deep_learning_paper_implementations).
\
The weights and samples are available in [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QK2cCDFKHjtL7C8WVHidXJHJnac_VZCT?usp=sharing).
